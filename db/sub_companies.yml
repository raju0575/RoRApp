    \ of information technology with Bill Gates. This agreement on strategic partnership\
    \ represented a foundation for the long-term cooperation aimed at boosting scientific\
    \ and technological development in Serbia, on all levels. \nSince opening, the\

    \ the prerequisites for entering the European Union, the local Microsoft office\
    \ has devoted its business operations to the legalization of software in Serbia\
    \ and to the fight against piracy. \nThe Belgrade office is also responsible for\
    \ the localization of Microsoft\u2019s most popular products. At the end of 2012,\
    \ Microsoft Windows 8 arrived in Serbia, also at the same time as around the world.\n\
    The Belgrade office has contributed to a better understanding of modern technologies,\
    \ increasing user productivity and preserving the culture and language in Serbia.\
    \ \nIn September 2005, Microsoft opened a Development center in Belgrade. Today,\
    \ the development team consists of more than 150 top IT experts from Serbia, all\

    provides real-time, dynamic threat protection without the use of signatures to
    protect an organization across the primary threat vectors and across the different
    stages of an attack life cycle. The core of the FireEye platform is a virtual

  description: "The beginning of the new millennium witnessed tremendous developments\
    \ taking place in India that unleashed the latent entrepreneurial energy in various\
    \ enterprises including construction. One such development was the emergence of\
    \ the Amrapali Group that started off some 10 years ago under the able guidance\
    \ of its Chairman & Managing Director Dr. Anil Kumar Sharma, a proud NIT & IIT\
    \ alumnus. This group is now leading the ranks in the real estate domain and that\
    \ too in a very short span of time. Today the group enjoys a pan-India presence\
    \ and has already delivered over 25 world-class projects. The group also has more\
    \ than 50 projects comprising residential, commercial and IT parks, in the pipeline.\
    \ Amrapali\u2019s projects delineate the skyline of Noida, the satellite city\
    \ of Delhi, and other cities such as Indore, Raipur, Jaipur, Patna, Udaipur, Lucknow\
    \ etc. It is our privilege to have the cricket maestro M.S.Dhoni as our brand\
    \ ambassador. The group, consolidating on its success, has made impressive forays\
    \ into hospitality, healthcare, education, entertainment and FMCG manufacturing.\n\
    \nIt is quite rare for a real estate developer to achieve such high repute and\
    \ standing as Amrapali has done. This is the time when the Indian economy is growing\
    \ steadily and without any doubt the real estate is one of its key drivers. We\
    \ are aware of the intense competition among the developers and are well prepared\
    \ to not only survive it but thrive in it. We take cognizance of the fact that\
    \ as the consumer awareness grows the factors such as the quality, range of amenities,\
    \ long-term performance and on-time delivery would be the discerning factors and\
    \ only the developers who can meet these criteria would survive.\n\nOur strong\
    \ base of technical expertise combined with a sturdy financial framework ensures\
    \ a long innings and an increased ability to stand by our long-term commitment\
    \ in developing healthy, pleasant and comfortable communities."

    To inspire a sense of well-being, through style, quality and practicality


    Our Values


    Inspiration


    Inspiration is multi-dimensional, it is derived from our pride and passion for
    what we create and our customers taking pleasure in what we produce.  The combination
    of these is what makes us work:  the whole being better than the sum of the parts.


    Style


    Style is paramount when creating luxury furniture: the design has a fundamental
    impact on the overall look being fashioned.  It has to reflect personality, environment,
    space, location and aspiration.  Understanding your dream is the first step to
    creating stylish furniture.


    Quality


    Everything we do, from the transformation of an idea through design to completed
    commission is undertaken with quality in mind.  Using superior quality materials,
    our talented craftsmen produce furniture that is a functional work of art.  Our
    guiding principles are excellence, detail and perfection in every stage of the
    manufacturing process.


    Practicality


    Furniture is made to be used, therefore we craft furniture that feels as beautiful
    as it is to observe.  A sense of overall well-being is at the heart of our business.'

    \ and has grown to become a major supermarket chain operating in North Carolina,\
    \ South Carolina and Virginia. \n\nThe company grew rapidly during the 1960s,\
    \  70s and early  80s. Lowes Foods was acquired by Merchants Distributors, Inc.\
    \ (MDI) in 1984 and began an aggressive expansion program in 1986, opening 19\
    \ stores over the next four years. In 1997, Lowes Foods acquired Byrds Food Stores,\
    \ located in eastern North Carolina. It continued its growth in 2000 with the\
    \ purchase of 13 Hannaford stores. Today Lowes Foods operates close to 100 stores\
    \ and continues to open new stores throughout North and South Carolina. Lowes\
    \ Foods continued to expand by opening its first Lowes Foods Fuel station in 2007.\
    \ In 2010, a new Lowes Foods concept store was opened in Hickory, NC and in 2011,\
    \ we introduced a new value format called Just$ave.\n \nIn 2013, Lowes Foods set\
    \ out to break the mold of the standard supermarket and create a distinctive grocery\
    \ shopping experience worthy of our Carolina roots. The development began with\
    \ in depth consumer research and a series of overnight workshops designed to get\
    \ the very best ideas from managers across all facets of the business including\
    \ all store managers and many from MDI. During these workshops, our new vision\
    \ for Lowes Foods was born: \u201CWe bring community back to the table.\u201D\
    \ And, a number of new concepts were created including Chicken Kitchen, SausageWorks,\
    \ Pick & Prep, and the Community Table. In January, 2013, Lowes Foods re-opened\
    \ the first store to offer all of the newly developed concepts in Clemmons, NC.\
    \ This spirit of transformation is being carried through all of the Lowes Foods\
    \ and Just$ave stores. And, the spark of innovation has led to continued development\
    \ of new concepts to further differentiate our stores. While selection may vary\
    \ from store to store, our commitment to quality, value and service are the same\

  description: 'Poindexter brings something "simply different to
    the world of tech support." With over ten years of experience, owner Lee Brandt
    feels that tech support is too corporate and impersonal. Citing Geek Squad or
    iYogi as prime examples, he argues that tech relies "too heavily on massive membership,
    too-fast turn around, and impersonal resolutions that don t explain anything.
    People s problems aren t getting fixed and they re wasting money on technicians
    who waste time."


    "In my experience, people really dislike tech support," continues Brandt. "Folks
    hate sitting on the phone, finally connected with someone who doesn t care and
    probably can t resolve your problem. I ve met countless people who would rather
    buy a new computer than fix a simple problem on their old one, so long as they
    can avoid calling tech support. This is why Poindexter always goes to where you
    need us, at your home or business, so we can get things done better. We re real
    people."


    Brandt is committed to keeping Poindexter s approach simple and direct.


    "We don t focus on big-scale. We help people. We fix problems. We refuse to take
    advantage of people in need by charging excessive fees for simple fixes. We take
    on fewer clients and work to make sure our clients  problems are resolved quickly
    and competently. If we don t know how to fix something, we don t just repeat some
    script - we figure it out, fix it, then help our client understand what happened."


    Poindexter is able to stay fast and friendly by putting a priority on local services,
    like malware removal, computer upgrades, and data backups and recovery. With technicians
    well-versed in iOS, Android, Mac, or Windows, Poindexter promises to offer the
    least expensive tech support solutions to clients in the Hampden area, Baltimore.
    Each service entails a small fee, so there s no need to sign up for any membership
    or package. Low cost, direct service, and real people to your door.'

  description: "My core offering is a Coach-Consultant Concept, which\
    \ can best be explained by splitting the two roles up.\n\nAs a business coach,\
    \ I help clients to create success by focusing on personal development: time management,\
    \ self-sabotaging behavior (like procrastination and distraction), finding clarity,\
    \ decision making, and getting into action. When I put on my coaching hat, I don\
    \ t give advice, instead, I help the client find the answers from within themselves.\n\
    \nAs a business consultant, I work with clients on strategy, planning and problem\
    \ solving. I help clients develop business skills and knowledge. These topics\
    \ range from designing a business model or marketing plan, to determining which\
    \ marketing techniques to use and how to use them. As well as helping clients\
    \ learn how to plan and implement various projects across their business. I give\
    \ advice, teach skills, and brainstorm with the client to produce practical results\
    \ and enhance strategic thinking.\n\nI pay attention to the outcomes the clients\
    \ seek. If it helps, I call myself a \"coach-consultant\" to show I use both coaching\
    \ and consulting techniques when working with clients.\n\nYou need both consulting\
    \ skills and coaching skills in order to be effective and provide real value.\
    \ I have been working within large corporate organisations and with business owners\
    \ and solo entrepreneurs and I rarely find one that doesn t need both coaching\
    \ and consulting.\n\nPeople almost never approach me and ask for straight coaching.\
    \ They ask for consulting which leads to coaching. They ask for practical advice\
    \ and brainstorming. \nIn the search to find solutions and to map out a strategy,\
    \ a business owners or business executives will stumble unless they do both the\
    \ personal development work and the business development work that leads to success.\n\
    \nMy approach is to offer either stand-alone coaching or consulting, or consulting\
    \ then offer you coaching support to ensure that you become the expert in our\
    \ own business."
